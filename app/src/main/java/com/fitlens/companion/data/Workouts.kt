/**
 * Create, update and delete workout data in FlexNotes: categories, exercises, sets, and per-day workout comments and
 * times. A "workout" is every set, comment and time logged on one date, as in FitNotes.
 *
 * ## Ownership
 * Every category, exercise, set, workout comment and workout time has a `source`:
 * - `fitnotes`: imported from a FitNotes backup and not changed since.
 * - `fitlens`: created in FlexNotes, or an imported row the user has edited in FlexNotes (editing makes it FlexNotes's).
 * Rows have FlexNotes's own stable `id`. Imported rows also keep their FitNotes id in `fitnotes_id`, for reference only.
 *
 * ## Conflict rules (shared with [FitNotesImporter])
 * 1. A FitNotes import only ever **adds** rows. It never deletes, edits or overwrites anything already in FlexNotes,
 *    whoever created it. FlexNotes never writes to FitNotes or its backups.
 * 2. Categories and exercises are matched **by name** (ignoring case and surrounding spaces), so imported and
 *    FlexNotes-logged history join up. When both exist, the FlexNotes row is kept as it is (its category, type, notes).
 * 3. A set is "already present" when a set on the same date, for the same exercise, with the same weight, reps,
 *    distance and time exists, whoever created it. Identical sets are counted, so three identical sets in a backup
 *    match three in FlexNotes. Re-importing the same backup therefore changes nothing.
 * 4. Workout comments and times are present when the same text (or the same start and end) exists on that date.
 * 5. What the user does in FlexNotes wins over later imports: renaming an exercise or category keeps it linked to the
 *    FitNotes name; deleting imported data, or editing an imported set, comment or time, is remembered in
 *    `import_rule` so the next import doesn't bring the original back. Re-creating a deleted exercise or category
 *    with the same name lets its FitNotes history import again.
 * 6. Body measurements merge the same way: a FitNotes value is skipped when the same measurement, date, time and value
 *    exists, or when a value entered by hand in FlexNotes has the same measurement, date and value.
